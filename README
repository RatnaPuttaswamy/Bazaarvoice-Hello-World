This is a reference application for the Bazaarvoice API.

The application periodically fetches recent reviews using Bazaarvoice API and displays reviews using Google Earth.
It demonstrates a client-side mash-up of the following three API's:

1. Bazaarvoice API
2. Google Earth and JS API
3. Digital Element IP Intelligence Geolocation API (hosted by Infochimps)


The application is using JSONP to make calls to Bazaarvoice and geolocation API's.

In order to run the application, do the following:

1. Get the code from github (download or clone)
2. Obtain API keys:
    a.) Obtain a Digital Element IP Intelligence Geolocation API KEY from http://www.infochimps.com/signup
    b.) Obtain a Bazaarvoice API key from http://developer.bazaarvoice.com
3. Put in your API keys:
    a.) Replace YOUR_BAZAARVOICE_HOSTNAME with your Bazaarvoice API hostname in scripts/earth_reviews.js
            - for example, production data access URL of: reviews.customername.com
            - for example, staging data access URL of: reviews.customername.com/bvstaging
    b.) Replace YOUR_BAZAARVOICE_API_KEY with your Bazaarvoice API key in scripts/earth_reviews.js
