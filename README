This is a reference application for the Bazaarvoice API.

The application periodically fetches recent reviews using Bazaarvoice API and displays reviews using Google Earth.
It demonstrates a client-side mash-up of the following three API's:

1. Bazaarvoice API
2. Google Earth API
3. Digital Element IP Intelligence API (hosted by Infochimps)

The application is using JSONP to make calls to Bazaarvoice and geolocation API's.

In order to run the application, do the following:

1. Get the code from github (download or clone)
2. Replace YOUR_BAZAARVOICE_API_KEY with your Bazaarvoice API key in scripts/earth_reviews.js
3. Replace YOUR_INFOCHIMPS_API_KEY with your Infochimps API key in scripts/earth_reviews.js.

4. Open index.html in a browser
5. Install Google Earth plug-in unless you already have it, and refresh the page.
 
Note that Google Earth works on Windows and Apple OS.
